### Hi there 👋
Hi， I'm Haotian Chai, a dog-lover, 🌈 friendly, living in Shanghai and Hangzhou.

Beta is our family member, a corgi. You can find her cute photos [here](https://tiant167.github.io/beta/)!

Currently I work at [AntGroup](https://www.antgroup.com/en) as full-stack engineer, former [Jike](https://okjike.com/), [Keep](https://www.keepkeep.com/) and [WandouLabs](https://www.wandoujia.com/).
